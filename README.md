Project 2 Requirement Document  


For this project I created a small trivia about marvel characters. The purpose is to have the people interact a person with this trivia. By creating these questions with multiple answers, the user could see if they got the answer correct.

In the process the first step was to figure out a way to enter the questions and have it to come out with a correct or wrong answer. If the answer is incorrect a false notice will pop out and if answer is correct a true notice will appear, you can check the answer by clicking on the “check your answer” button. Once you enter all the true questions you can click on the “Next” button and it will take you to the following answer.
